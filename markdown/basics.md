# Markdown Basics

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read, write, and parse into HTML and other formats. It was created in 2004 by John Gruber, and as of 2016, is one of the most widely-used formats for discussion technologies like GitHub, Reddit, Stack Exchange, and Slack.

Markdown comes in different implementations depending on the site, but the basics (headings, lists, quotes, links) remain the same. GitHub provides a great summary of the basic and extended [Markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

In order to get a file to format in Markdown on Github, it justs needs a  `.md` file extension. GitHub's default text editor and preview window are enough for basic Markdown writing, and [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) is available for more advanced jobs.
