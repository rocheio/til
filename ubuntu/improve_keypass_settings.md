# Improve Keepass Default Settings

[Keepass](http://keepass.info/) isn't fully integrated into the browser like other options, but it does offer a ton of the same features under the hood.

To open Keepass, hit `super` to search for and open it. From the `Tools` menu, open the `Options` window.

On the `Interface` panel, and under the `Quick Search` header, check `Focus entry list after successful search`.

On the `Security` panel, check the box to enable `Passwords expire after 90 days`.
